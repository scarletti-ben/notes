Your understanding is partially correct, but let me clarify the process step by step:

1. **Include jQuery:**
   - You start by including the jQuery library in your HTML file. You can either download the jQuery file and include it locally or use a content delivery network (CDN) to include it. Here is an example using a CDN:

     ```html
     <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
     ```

2. **Create HTML Element:**
   - Create an HTML element that you want to manipulate using jQuery. This can be any HTML element such as a div, button, input, etc.

     ```html
     <button id="myButton">Click me</button>
     ```

3. **Use jQuery Selector to Target Element:**
   - Use a jQuery selector to target the HTML element. The selector syntax is similar to CSS selectors. In this case, we're selecting the button with the id "myButton."

     ```javascript
     $(document).ready(function() {
       var $myButton = $('#myButton');
     });
     ```

4. **Attach jQuery Functions:**
   - Once you have the jQuery object representing your HTML element, you can attach jQuery functions to it. These functions will be executed when certain events occur. For example, you might want to execute some code when the button is clicked.

     ```javascript
     $(document).ready(function() {
       var $myButton = $('#myButton');

       $myButton.click(function() {
         // Your code to be executed when the button is clicked
         alert('Button clicked!');
       });
     });
     ```

5. **Document Ready:**
   - It's a good practice to encapsulate your jQuery code inside `$(document).ready()` or the shorthand `$(function() {...})` to ensure that the DOM has fully loaded before executing your jQuery code.

Putting it all together:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>jQuery Example</title>
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    $(document).ready(function() {
      var $myButton = $('#myButton');

      $myButton.click(function() {
        // Your code to be executed when the button is clicked
        alert('Button clicked!');
      });
    });
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <button id="myButton">Click me</button>
</body>
</html>
```

This example demonstrates the basic process of including jQuery, selecting an HTML element, and attaching a function to a specific event (in this case, the click event).
