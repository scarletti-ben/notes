# Markdown Site Builder

Uses a `builder.py` python file to convert Markdown files / notes to HTML files and then generates `index.html`

- Combines the content of `core.html` with the .html files generated in the conversion process to then build `index.html`

Elements generated by `builder.py` are given the *injection* class `<div class="injection">`

Uses *BeautfulSoup4* for html parsing in python
