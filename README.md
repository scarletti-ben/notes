# Markdown Site Builder

Access to the site via https://scarletti-ben.github.io/notes or via repository settings

Uses a `builder.py` python file to convert Markdown files / notes to HTML files and then generates `index.html`

- Combines the content of `core.html` with the .html files generated in the conversion process to then build `index.html`

Elements generated by `builder.py` are given the *injection* class `<div class="injection">` which are then all encapsulated by a single `<div class="injection-container">`

Uses *BeautfulSoup4* for html parsing in python

Bugs:
- If a markdown file does not have a header then the searchbar on the site will not show it when a search is made and then cancelled
